## Vet-Clinic
The app manage the booking of a vet clinic through the implemented Google Calendar.
'Client` users, besides managing their profile, can book an appointment at the clinic for their pet,
or request home service, from the home page.
The requested address is set by default to the client's address, but can be changed by clicking on
the map below, and setting up the draggable marker.
'Employee' users have access to the full CRUD operations over both database and Google scheduler.
They can add, edit and delete the clients, so like  other employees, their pets and the appointments
